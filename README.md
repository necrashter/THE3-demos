# THE3-demos

The purpose of this repository is to share the interesting simulations we made in THE3.

## demo.py

This file is based on draw.py with some new features such as panning, zooming and adjusting the delay at runtime. It can also change evaluator.py with selected demo.

Put demo.py in the same directory as the3.py and evaluator.py before running.

You can contribute to this repository by adding your own demos or enchancing demo.py.
